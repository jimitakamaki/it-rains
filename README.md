# It rains :cloud_with_rain:

It rains is a simple game project I made as an exercise in Python Programming MOOC 2022. 

If you want to try playing it, you need to have Python and pygame installed. I made this with Python version 3.10.8 and pygame version 2.1.2 but I think it should be compatible with other versions as well.

If the game window doesn't fit your screen, change the self.width and self.height values on lines 11 and 12 of it_rains.py.

All images are from the course materials, I do not own them. :)
